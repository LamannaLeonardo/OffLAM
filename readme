To reproduce the paper results, download the OffLAM traces of all considered domains from LINK,
and unzip them into the directory "Analysis".

To change the experiment among: partial states, partial actions, and partial states and actions, you need to set
the value of variable 'EXP' in Configuration.py

To test OffLAM on your own traces of a domain x, e.g. with partial states, add them to the
directory "Input traces/OffLAM/x/partial_states/".

The paper results are available at this LINK
